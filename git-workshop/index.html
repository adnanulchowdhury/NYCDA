    <p> Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) is a scrambling and trailing vine in the flowering plant family Cucurbitaceae.<br> 
        species originated in southern Africa, with evidence of its cultivation in Ancient Egypt.<br>
        It is grown in tropical and subtropical areas worldwide for its large edible fruit, also known as a watermelon,<br>
        which is a special kind of berry with a hard rind and no internal division, botanically called a pepo.<br>
        The sweet, juicy flesh is usually deep red to pink, with many black seeds, although seedless varieties have been cultivated.<br>
        The fruit can be eaten raw or pickled and the rind is edible after cooking.<br>

        Considerable breeding effort has been put into disease-resistant varieties.<br>
        Many cultivars are available that produce mature fruit within 100 days of planting the crop.<br>
